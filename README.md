# Winter Fox Engine

**Winter Fox Engine** is a 3D game engine built from scratch in Java using LWJGL and OpenGL.

This project was my first step into the world of programming and game engine development. I started it as an experiment to learn how 3D rendering works at a low level using OpenGL and Java, without relying on existing engines or frameworks.

Since I was still learning the basics of computer graphics, the code quality may not be ideal or consistent â€” but this engine represents an important part of my learning journey.

Despite the challenges, I truly enjoyed working on Winter Fox Engine. It allowed me to dive deep into topics like real-time rendering, shader programming, terrain rendering, and optimization techniques. It sparked a lasting interest in low-level graphics and game development overall.

- Terrain with Level of Detail (LoD)
- Animated water with reflections, refractions, and wave effects
- Skybox with dynamic day-night cycle
- Frustum culling
- Grass rendering using hardware instancing
- Basic physics: collision detection between player and world objects
- GUI system: texture-based UI with text rendering (e.g. inventory, stats, crafting)
